title: "[INTEGRATION] Source Form Property"

display-name: "[INTEGRATION]"

description: ""

# NOTE: object-attributes is only required if the object has attributes
#       that are specific to it. Ex: `platform.github` has `access_token`
#       and `repository` attributes specific to it, along with the other
#       attributes common to SaaS: `frequency_in_minutes`, `anchor_time`,
#       and `start_time`. 
#       The common attributes will display automatically unless the
#       `attribute.exclude` contains the form-property's `api-type` value.

# 		Common fields:  _data/connect/common/all-sources.yml
