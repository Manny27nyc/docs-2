  - title: "pricing"
    content: |
      Unlike many other cloud-based data warehouse solutions, {{ destination.display_name }}'s pricing model is based on **usage** and not a fixed-rate. This means that your bill can vary over time. 

      Before fully committing yourself to using {{ destination.display_name }} as your data warehouse, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the {{ destination.display_name }} pricing model and how using Stitch may impact your costs.

      **[Learn more about Stitch & {{ destination.display_name }} pricing]({{ link.destinations.overviews.bigquery-pricing | prepend: site.baseurl }})**

  - title: "setup"
    content: |
      To set up {{ destination.display_name }}, Stitch requires:

      1. **A user with full access to an existing [Google Cloud Platform project within {{ destination.display_name }}]({{ destination.setup-project }}){:target="_blank"}**. Stitch won't be able to create one for you.
      2. **Admin permissions for BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**. This includes the BigQuery Admin and Storage Admin permissions.
      2. **Access to a project where [billing is enabled]({{ destination.enable-billing }}){:target="_blank"} and a credit card is attached**. Even if you're using BigQuery's free trial, billing must still be enabled for Stitch to load data.
