      {% assign window = "Attribution Window" %}
      {% assign table = "activities" %}
      {% assign replication-key = "date_created" %}
      {% assign start-date ="07/03/2017" %}

      {% assign replication-key-ongoing = "2017-09-30 00:00:00" %}

      {% capture reason %}
      As {{ integration.display_name }} doesn't currently provide a way to query for activities based on modification time, Stitch replicates data in this way to ensure updated activities are captured. A list of available querying methods can be found in [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://developer.close.io/#activities-list-or-filter-all-activity-types){:target="new"}.
      {% endcapture %}

      {% include integrations/saas/attribution-windows.html attribution-reason=reason%}

      Refer to the documentation for each of these tables in the next section for more info.
