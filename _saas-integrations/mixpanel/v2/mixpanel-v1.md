#      Feature Summary       #
# -------------------------- #

feature-summary: |
  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration replicates data using the {{ integration.api | flatify | strip }}. Refer to the [Schema](#schema) section for a list of objects available for replication.


# -------------------------- #
#      Incompatibilities     #
# -------------------------- #

## uncomment section below if integration is compatible with any Stitch destinations
## if incompatible with multiple destinations, create a section for each destination

## incompatible:
  ## [redshift]: "always,sometimes,never"
  ## reason: "copy"

#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Admin privileges**. Your role in your {{ integration.display_name }} account must be admin in order to be able to retrieve your API secret.

setup-steps:
  - title: "Retrieve your {{ integration.display_name }} project timezone and API secret"
    anchor: "retrieve-timezone-api-secret"
    content: |
      1. Login to your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      2. In the dropdown menu in the upper left corner of the page, select the project you want to replicate data from.
      3. Hover over the **Settings** icon in the upper right corner. In the **PROJECT SETTINGS** portion of the dropdown menu, click on the link with the name of your project.
      4. Copy the **Project Timezone** and **API Secret**, and paste those values someplace safe to use for the next step.
  - title: "add integration"
    content: |
      4. In the **API Secret** field, paste the **API Secret** you retrieved from [step 1](#retrieve-timezone-api-secret).
      5. In the **Attribution Window** field, enter the number of days you want your tables' attribution window to be. For more information on attribution windows, refer to the [Replication section](#attribution-windows-extraction).
      6. In the **Date Window Size** field, enter the number of days desired for a date looping window for the `export`, `funnel`, and `revenue` tables. The default `date_window_size` is 30 days.

      Date looping will return records whose `from_date` and `to_date` fall between the number of days in the defined window size.

      **Note**: You may want to decrease the number of days if your project has a large volume of events. 
      7. In the **Project Timezone** field, paste the **Project Timezone** you retrieved from [step 1](#retrieve-timezone-api-secret).
      8. In the **Select Properties By Default**, enter **true** or leave it blank. This is an optional field. When set to `true`, this parameter captures new properties in the `events` and `engage` tables' records. If set to false, new properties will be ignored.

#      Replication Info      #
# -------------------------- #

  - title: "Attribution windows and data extraction"

    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="The info in this section only applies to tables using Incremental Replication. Tables using Full Table Replication replicate fully during each replication job and don't use attribution windows." %}

      When Stitch runs a replication job for {{ integration.display_name }}, it will use the value of the **Attribution Window** setting to query for and extract data for Incremental tables. An attribution window is a period of time for attributing results to ads and the lookback period after those actions occur during which ad results are counted.

      In the sections below are examples of how attribution windows impact how Stitch extracts data during historical and ongoing replication jobs.
