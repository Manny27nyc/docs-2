# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Administrator permissions in Zendesk**. Some data types in Zendesk may only be accessed with Admin permissions. For example: To replicate ticket metric or tag data, Zendesk's API requires a user with Admin permissions.

      To ensure you can replicate all the data you need, we recommend a user with Admin permissions set up the integration.
      
  - item: |
      **To be on a specific Zendesk plan, if replicating ticket forms.** In this case, you need to be on an Enterprise Zendesk plan or a Professional Zendesk plan with the ticket forms add-on to replicate the `ticket_forms` table.

      All other tables, with the exception of `ticket_forms`, will be available for replication even if you aren't on either of these plans.

      4. In the **Zendesk Subdomain** field, enter your Zendesk site prefix. For example: For `stitchdata.zendesk.com`, only `stitchdata` would be entered into this field.
