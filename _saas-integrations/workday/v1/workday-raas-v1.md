#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "Retrieve your report URL"
    anchor: "retrieve-report-url"
    content: |
      1. Login to your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      2. Navigate to your reports.
      3. Select the report you want to replicate in Stitch and ensure that the **Enable As Web Service** box is checked.
      4. Copy the **Workday XML** REST link and keep it available for the next step.
      {% include layout/image.html file="/integrations/workday-report-url.jpg" max-width="415" %}

      If you would like to replicate multiple reports, repeat steps 3 and 4.

  - title: "add integration"
    content: |
      4. In the **Username** field, enter the username for your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      5. In the **Password** field, enter the password for your {{ integration.display_ name }} account.
      6. In the **Report** field, enter the name you would like to name your table. Since this integration replicates data from reports, Stitch converts them into tables.
      7. In the **Report** field, enter the report URL you obtained in [step 1](#retrieve-report-url).

      If you would like to replicate more reports, click on **Configure another report**.

     To replicate your report data, this integration requires you to first define a report within your Workday tenant. The URL for that report is what Stitch uses to extract your data and then transform them into tables.
