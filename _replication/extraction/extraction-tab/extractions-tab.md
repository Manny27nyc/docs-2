      The features in the {{ app.tabs.extractions }} tab may not be available for some integrations.

      Generally, these features are available for integrations powered by Singer taps. As integrations are converted to the Singer system, the features listed below will be made available.

      **Note**: Integrations that send data directly and continuously to Stitch will not have these features. This applies to Import API and webhook-based integrations.
