For the connection from Stitch to be successful, you'll need to configure the firewall for your {{ destination.display_name }} instance to allow access from our IP addresses.

1. Sign into your [{{ destination.display_name }}](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/account/){:target="new"} account and navigate to your dashboard.
{% endunless %}

2. In the sidenav, click **SQL databases**.
3. On the page that displays, click the name of the database you want to connect to Stitch.

{% case include.type %}

<!-- For SSH connections only -->
{% when 'ssh' %}
1. Create a rule for the virtual machine's IP address:
   - **Rule name**: Enter a name for the rule. For example: `Stitch VM`
   - **Start IP**: Paste the virtual machine's private IP address.
   - **End IP**: Paste the virtual machine's private IP address again.

   Below is what the rule should look like when finished:
   
   ![IP rule for a virtual machine]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/destinations/azure-sql-dw-vm-ip-rule.png)
1. Click **Save**.

<!-- For direct connections only -->
{% else %}
1. For each of Stitch's IP addresses listed below, create a rule:
   - **Rule name**: Enter a name for the rule. For example: `Stitch<number>`
   - **Start IP**: Paste one of Stitch's IP addresses.
   - **End IP**: Paste the same IP address.

   Stitch's IP addresses are:

   {% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}
    - {{ ip-address.ip | remove: "/32" }}
    {% endfor %}
1. Click the three dots to the right of the **End IP** field to add the rule.
1. Repeat steps {{ steps }} until there is a rule for each IP address. The screen should look similar to the following when you're finished:

   ![IP address rules for Stitch's IP addresses in Microsoft Azure firewall settings]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/destinations/microsoft-azure-ip-addresses.png)

   **Note**: You may also want to add your own IP address(es) to this list. This ensures that you'll also be able to connect to the database as needed.
1. Click **Save**.
