Your organization may require a different process, but the simplest way to create this user is to execute the following query when logged into the {{ integration.display_name }} database as a user with the right to grant privileges.

Additionally, this user should also own the schema that Stitch is being granted access to.

```sql
{{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.postgres.create-user-command }}
```

Replace `[secure password here]` with a secure password{% if integration.ssh == true %}, which can be different than the SSH password.{% else %}.{% endif %} Additionally, make sure you replace `[database_name]` and `[schema_name]` with the appropriate names in your database.

If you want to connect multiple databases or schemas, repeat this process as necessary.
