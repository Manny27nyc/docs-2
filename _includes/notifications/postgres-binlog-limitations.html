{% capture logical-replication-limitations %}
On August 6, 2018, we discovered some limitations with {{ integration.display_name }} Log-based Replication. Currently, Log-based Replication requires:

- **PostgreSQL databases running PostgreSQL versions 9.4.x-9.9.x.** If your database is running PostgreSQL 10 or greater, Log-based Replication will not work. Some of the functions Stitch uses to replicate data were renamed in PostgreSQL 10.

   We are working on adding support for logical replication - which is what Stitch uses to perform Log-based Replication - to the integration. In the meantime, use Key-based Incremental Replication.

- **A connection to the master instance.** Log-based Replication will not work on read replicas. When PostgreSQL initially released logical replication, support for replicating from read replicas wasn't implemented.

   [Based on their forums](https://commitfest.postgresql.org/12/788/){:target="new"}, PostgreSQL is working on adding this feature to a future version. Until this feature is released, you can connect Stitch to the master instance and use Log-based Replication, **or** connect to a read replica and use Key-based Incremental Replication.
