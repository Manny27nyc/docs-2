  The `ads_insights_region` table contains entries for each campaign/set/ad combination for each day, along with detailed statistics, segmented by region. This table enables you to view your data by the region (ex: state or province) where people live or were located when they saw your ads, depending on how the location targeting was set.

  This table contains the same fields as the [`ads_insights`](#ads_insights) table, with the exception of `region`.

  **Note**: Data for deleted ads, adsets, and campaigns will not appear in this table even if the option in the integration's settings is enabled.
