  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains "raw data dumps" of tracked events.

  The schema for this table is dynamic, meaning that the columns Stitch detects are dependent upon the properties provided upon upload in {{ integration.display_name }}. For every property available in {{ integration.display_name }} for `{{ table.name }}` records, Stitch will display a column in the integration's **Tables to Replicate** tab.
