#      Setup Requirements    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **The `CREATE USER` or `INSERT` privilege (for the `mysql` database).** The [`CREATE USER` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-user.html){:target="new"} is required to create a database user for Stitch.
  - item: |
      **The `GRANT OPTION` privilege in {{ integration.display_name }}.** The [`GRANT OPTION` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_grant-option){:target="new"} is required to grant the necessary privileges to the Stitch database user.
  - item: |
      **For Log-based replication:**
      1. Privileges in Azure that allow you to modify server parameters.
      2. MySQL master server must be in a General Purpose or Memory Optimized pricing tier. These are the tiers that allow you to create {{ integration.display_name }} read replicas.

#     Setup Instructions     #

      - title: "Configure server settings"
        anchor: "configure-database-server-settings"
        content: |
          In this step, you'll configure your {{ integration.display_name }} server to use Log-based Incremental Replication.

          {% capture server-instructions %}
          1. In your **Azure portal**, locate your **Azure Database for MySQL** server.
          2. Click **Settings > Server Parameters**.
          3. Define the requred server settings using their pre-defined defaults. Refer to the <a href="#server-settings-details" data-toggle="tab">Server settings list</a> tab for explanations of these parameters and their default values. **No other configuration is required on your part.**
          {% endcapture %}
          
          {% include integrations/templates/configure-server-settings.html %}

    anchor: "db-user"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Note**: You must have the `CREATE USER` and `GRANT OPTION` privileges to complete this step." %} 

      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "connect-stitch"

      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.
