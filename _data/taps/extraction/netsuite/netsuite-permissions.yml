          Necessary to allow Stitch to access your NetSuite account.

          **Note**: NetSuite only allows `Full` as the level for this permission, but this only grants read-only access to the account. For Stitch to access any entity data, such as `Departments`, permission must also be granted to that entity.

        notes: |
          Allows Stitch to query for deleted records in objects that the Stitch user has access to. For example: If access to `transactions` is granted, Stitch can replicate deleted transaction records.

          **Note**: NetSuite only allows `Full` as the level for this permission, but this only grants read-only access to deleted records of any type. For example: If the `Departments` permission is set to `View`, Stitch will be able to see and replicate department data (existing and deleted), but not create, delete, or edit records.
