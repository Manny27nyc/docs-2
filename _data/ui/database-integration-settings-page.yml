## This file contains the default field names and descriptions for
## the fields in the Database Integrations Settings page.

## As the required fields vary from integration to integration, 
## each integration type below lists the fields required for its
## specific setup and, if applicable, a integration that's specific
## to that integration.

## The defaults for the fields and descriptions are outlined below.
## They are set up as references - to use them, type an asterisk and
## then the ID of whatever reference you want. Jekyll will print the 
## result.

## Ex: *host-copy
## Will produce the following when the site is built:
## "Enter the host address (endpoint) used by the [integration-name] instance."


# -------------------------- #
#       Default Fields       #
# -------------------------- #
## Defines the default field names in the Database Integration Settings page.

default-fields:
  integration-name: &integration-name Integration Name
  host: &host Host (Endpoint)
  port: &port Port
  username: &username Username
  password: &password Password
  database: &database Database
  ssl: &ssl Connect using SSL

# -------------------------- #
#        Default Copy        #
# -------------------------- #
## Default copy for fields. Used when the user doesn't require any 
## additional or info specific to the integration to complete the setup.

default-copy:
  integration-name: &integration-name-copy |
    Enter a name for the integration. This is the name that will display on the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }} for the integration; it’ll also be used to create the schema in your data warehouse.

          For example, the name “Stitch {{ integration.display_name }}” would create a schema called `stitch_{{ integration.name |
     replace:"-","_" }}` in the data warehouse. **Note:** The schema name cannot be changed after the integration is saved.

  host: &host-copy |
    Enter the host address (endpoint) used by the {{ integration.display_name }} instance.

          In general, this will be `127.0.0.1` (localhost), but could also be some other network address (ex: `192.68.0.1`) or your server's public IP address. **Note:** This must be the actual address - entering `localhost` into this field will cause connection issues.
  port: &port-copy |
    Enter the port used by the {{ integration.display_name }} instance. The default is `{{ integration.port }}`.
  username: &username-copy Enter the Stitch {{ integration.display_name }} database user's username.
  password: &password-copy |
    Enter the password for the Stitch {{ destination.display_name }} database user.
  database: &database-copy |
    Enter the name of the {{ integration.display_name }} database you want to connect to Stitch. Stitch will 'find' all databases you give the Stitch user access to - a default database is only used to complete the connection.

          This is required for {{ integration.display_name }} integrations.
  optional-database: &optional-database-copy |
      **Optional:** Enter the name of the default database Stitch will connect to. Stitch will 'find' all databases you give the Stitch user access to - a default database is only used to test and complete the connection.
  ssl: &ssl-copy |
    **Note:** The database must support and allow SSL connections for this setting to work correctly.

#         SSH Fields         #

## These fields are used when the instructions are for connecting
## a database using an SSH tunnel.

    copy: &ssh-host-copy "Enter the IP address or hostname of the server Stitch will SSH into."
  - name: &ssh-port SSH Port
    copy: &ssh-port-copy "Enter the SSH port on your server. (`22` by default)"
  - name: &ssh-user SSH User
    copy: &ssh-user-copy "Enter the Stitch Linux (SSH) user’s username."

            **Note:** If you're connecting an Atlas-based {{ integration.display_name }} instance, this must be the `admin` database. See the [Create a Mongo Database User section](#create-database-user) for more info on this requirement.
