  - message: *malformed-sheet
    id: "malformed-sheet"
    applicable-to: &google-sheets-v1 "Google Sheets v1 integrations"
    level: "info"
    category: "Sheet setup"
    version: "1" 
    summary: "Malformed sheet"
    cause: |
      The sheet isn't formatted according to [Stitch's requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/google-sheets#setup-requirements).

  - message: *empty-sheet
    id: "empty-sheet"
    applicable-to: &google-sheets-v1 "Google Sheets v1 integrations"
    level: "info"
    category: "Sheet setup"
    version: "1" 
    summary: "Empty sheet"
    cause: |
      The sheet doesn't have a header row and a data row, as per [Stitch's requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/google-sheets#setup-requirements).
    fix-it: |
      Modify the sheet so that it contains a header row in the first row and a full row of data in the second row.

      **Note**: Columns in the data row (second row) must all have non-`NULL` values. If a column in this row has a `NULL` value, a [malformed sheet error](#malformed-sheet) will surface during Extraction.
